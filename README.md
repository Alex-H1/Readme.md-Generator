# README.md-Generator


## Description
This is my good README.md generator this takes in user imput and styles them in a markdown page to generate a good README.

## Installation 
 this application does not have a user interface so everything is done through JavaScript and Node.js as well as inquierer.
 The first step in making this application were the questions, after making the questions I then put that array into a inquierer prompt. When the user then answers the prompts the response is then inputed to a write file function that then generates a markdown template that also generates a license badge.
